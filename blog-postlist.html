                Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science which focuses on the

                Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers and systems to derive
                meaningful information from digital images, videos and other visual inputs — and take actions or make
                recommendations based on that information. If AI enables computers to think, computer vision enables
                them to see, observe and understand.

                Scientists and engineers have been trying to develop ways for machines to see and understand visual data
                for about 60 years. Experimentation began in 1959 when neurophysiologists showed a cat an array of
                images, attempting to correlate a response in its brain. They discovered that it responded first to hard
                edges or lines, and scientifically, this meant that image processing starts with simple shapes like
                straight edges.

                As machine learning technology has developed, it has certainly made our lives easier. However,
                implementing machine learning in businesses has also raised a number of ethical concerns about AI

                There is a lot of research being done in the computer vision field, but it’s not just research.
                Real-world applications demonstrate how important computer vision is to endeavors in business,
                entertainment, transportation, healthcare and everyday life. A key driver for the growth of these
                applications is the flood of visual information flowing from smartphones, security systems, traffic
                cameras and other visually instrumented devices. This data could play a major role in operations across
                industries, but today goes unused. The information creates a test bed to train computer vision
                applications and a launchpad for them to become part of a range of human activities:
