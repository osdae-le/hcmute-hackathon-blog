        <h2 class="sub-heading">1. What is Machine Learning?</h2>
        <p class="post-text">Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science which
            focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its
            accuracy.</p>
        <p class="post-text">Machine learning is an important component of the growing field of data science. Through
            the use of statistical methods, algorithms are trained to make classifications or predictions, and to
            uncover key insights in data mining projects. These insights subsequently drive decision making within
            applications and businesses, ideally impacting key growth metrics. As big data continues to expand and grow,
            the market demand for data scientists will increase. They will be required to help identify the most
            relevant business questions and the data to answer them.</p>
        <p class="post-text">Machine learning algorithms are typically created using frameworks that accelerate solution
            development, such as TensorFlow and PyTorch.

        </p>
        <h2 class="sub-heading">2. How machine learning works</h2>
        <p class="post-text">- A Decision Process: In general, machine learning algorithms are used to make a prediction
            or classification. Based on some input data, which can be labeled or unlabeled, your algorithm will produce
            an estimate about a pattern in the data.</p>
        <p class="post-text">- An Error Function: An error function evaluates the prediction of the model. If there are
            known examples, an error function can make a comparison to assess the accuracy of the model.</p>
        <p class="post-text">- A Model Optimization Process: If the model can fit better to the data points in the
            training set, then weights are adjusted to reduce the discrepancy between the known example and the model
            estimate. The algorithm will repeat this “evaluate and optimize” process, updating weights autonomously
            until a threshold of accuracy has been met. </p>

        <h2 class="sub-heading">3. Machine Learning vs. Deep Learning vs. Neural Networks</h2>
        <p class="post-text">Since deep learning and machine learning tend to be used interchangeably, it’s worth noting
            the nuances between the two. Machine learning, deep learning, and neural networks are all sub-fields of
            artificial intelligence. However, neural networks is actually a sub-field of machine learning, and deep
            learning is a sub-field of neural networks.</p>
        <p class="post-text">The way in which deep learning and machine learning differ is in how each algorithm learns.
            "Deep" machine learning can use labeled datasets, also known as supervised learning, to inform its
            algorithm, but it doesn’t necessarily require a labeled dataset. Deep learning can ingest unstructured data
            in its raw form (e.g., text or images), and it can automatically determine the set of features which
            distinguish different categories of data from one another. This eliminates some of the human intervention
            required and enables the use of larger data sets.</p>
        <p class="post-text">Neural networks, or artificial neural networks (ANNs), are comprised of node layers,
            containing an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each node, or artificial neuron,
            connects to another and has an associated weight and threshold. If the output of any individual node is
            above the specified threshold value, that node is activated, sending data to the next layer of the network.
            Otherwise, no data is passed along to the next layer of the network by that node. The “deep” in deep
            learning is just referring to the number of layers in a neural network. A neural network that consists of
            more than three layers—which would be inclusive of the input and the output—can be considered a deep
            learning algorithm or a deep neural network. A neural network that only has three layers is just a basic
            neural network.</p>
        <p class="post-text">Deep learning and neural networks are credited with accelerating progress in areas such as
            computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition.</p>
