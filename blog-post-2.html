        <h2 class="sub-heading">1. What is Computer Vision?</h2>
        <p class="post-text">Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers and
            systems to derive meaningful information from digital images, videos and other visual inputs — and take
            actions or make recommendations based on that information. If AI enables computers to think, computer vision
            enables them to see, observe and understand.</p>
        <p class="post-text">Computer vision works much the same as human vision, except humans have a head start. Human
            sight has the advantage of lifetimes of context to train how to tell objects apart, how far away they are,
            whether they are moving and whether there is something wrong in an image.</p>
        <p class="post-text">Computer vision trains machines to perform these functions, but it has to do it in much
            less time with cameras, data and algorithms rather than retinas, optic nerves and a visual cortex. Because a
            system trained to inspect products or watch a production asset can analyze thousands of products or
            processes a minute, noticing imperceptible defects or issues, it can quickly surpass human capabilities.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-heading">2. How does computer vision work?</h2>
        <p class="post-text">- A Decision Process: In general, machine learning algorithms are used to make a prediction
            or classification. Based on some input data, which can be labeled or unlabeled, your algorithm will produce
            an estimate about a pattern in the data.</p>
        <p class="post-text">- An Error Function: An error function evaluates the prediction of the model. If there are
            known examples, an error function can make a comparison to assess the accuracy of the model.</p>
        <p class="post-text">- A Model Optimization Process: If the model can fit better to the data points in the
            training set, then weights are adjusted to reduce the discrepancy between the known example and the model
            estimate. The algorithm will repeat this “evaluate and optimize” process, updating weights autonomously
            until a threshold of accuracy has been met. </p>
