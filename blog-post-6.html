        <h2 class="sub-heading">1. Python and the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)</h2>
        <p class="post-text">
            The Python programing language provides a wide range of tools and libraries for attacking specific NLP
            tasks. Many of these are found in the Natural Language Toolkit, or NLTK, an open source collection of
            libraries, programs, and education resources for building NLP programs.
        </p>
        <p class="post-text">
            The NLTK includes libraries for many of the NLP tasks listed above, plus libraries for subtasks, such as
            sentence parsing, word segmentation, stemming and lemmatization (methods of trimming words down to their
            roots), and tokenization (for breaking phrases, sentences, paragraphs and passages into tokens that help the
            computer better understand the text). It also includes libraries for implementing capabilities such as
            semantic reasoning, the ability to reach logical conclusions based on facts extracted from text.
        </p>
        <h2 class="sub-heading">2. Statistical NLP, machine learning, and deep learning</h2>
        <p class="post-text">
            The earliest NLP applications were hand-coded, rules-based systems that could perform certain NLP tasks, but
            couldn't easily scale to accommodate a seemingly endless stream of exceptions or the increasing volumes of
            text and voice data.
        </p>
        <p class="post-text">
            Enter statistical NLP, which combines computer algorithms with machine learning and deep learning models to
            automatically extract, classify, and label elements of text and voice data and then assign a statistical
            likelihood to each possible meaning of those elements. Today, deep learning models and learning techniques
            based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) enable NLP systems that
            'learn' as they work and extract ever more accurate meaning from huge volumes of raw, unstructured, and
            unlabeled text and voice data sets.
