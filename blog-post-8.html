        <p class="post-text">
            While it’s getting easier to obtain resources to develop computer vision applications, an important question
            to answer early on is: What exactly will these applications do? Understanding and defining specific computer
            vision tasks can focus and validate projects and applications and make it easier to get started.

            Here are a few examples of established computer vision tasks:
        </p>
        <h2 class="sub-heading">1. Image classification</h2>
        <p class="post-text">
            Image classification sees an image and can classify it (a dog, an apple, a person’s face). More precisely,
            it is able to accurately predict that a given image belongs to a certain class. For example, a social media
            company might want to use it to automatically identify and segregate objectionable images uploaded by users.
        </p>
        <h2 class="sub-heading">2. Object detection</h2>
        <p class="post-text">
            Object detection can use image classification to identify a certain class of image and then detect and
            tabulate their appearance in an image or video. Examples include detecting damages on an assembly line or
            identifying machinery that requires maintenance.
        </p>
        <h2 class="sub-heading">3. Object tracking</h2>
        <p class="post-text">
            Object tracking follows or tracks an object once it is detected. This task is often executed with images
            captured in sequence or real-time video feeds. Autonomous vehicles, for example, need to not only classify
            and detect objects such as pedestrians, other cars and road infrastructure, they need to track them in
            motion to avoid collisions and obey traffic laws.
        </p>
        <h2 class="sub-heading">4. Content-based image retrieval</h2>
        <p class="post-text">
            Content-based image retrieval uses computer vision to browse, search and retrieve images from large data
            stores, based on the content of the images rather than metadata tags associated with them. This task can
            incorporate automatic image annotation that replaces manual image tagging. These tasks can be used for
            digital asset management systems and can increase the accuracy of search and retrieval.
