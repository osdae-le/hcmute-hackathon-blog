            Machine learning models fall into three primary categories.
        </p>
        <h2 class="sub-heading">1. Supervised machine learning</h2>
        <p class="post-text">Supervised learning, also known as supervised machine learning, is defined by its use of
            labeled datasets to train algorithms to classify data or predict outcomes accurately. As input data is fed
            into the model, the model adjusts its weights until it has been fitted appropriately. This occurs as part of
            the cross validation process to ensure that the model avoids overfitting or underfitting. Supervised
            learning helps organizations solve a variety of real-world problems at scale, such as classifying spam in a
            separate folder from your inbox. Some methods used in supervised learning include neural networks, naïve
            bayes, linear regression, logistic regression, random forest, and support vector machine (SVM).
        </p>
        <h2 class="sub-heading">2. Unsupervised machine learning</h2>
        <p class="post-text">Unsupervised learning, also known as unsupervised machine learning, uses machine learning
            algorithms to analyze and cluster unlabeled datasets. These algorithms discover hidden patterns or data
            groupings without the need for human intervention. This method’s ability to discover similarities and
            differences in information make it ideal for exploratory data analysis, cross-selling strategies, customer
            segmentation, and image and pattern recognition. It’s also used to reduce the number of features in a model
            through the process of dimensionality reduction. Principal component analysis (PCA) and singular value
            decomposition (SVD) are two common approaches for this. Other algorithms used in unsupervised learning
            include neural networks, k-means clustering, and probabilistic clustering methods. </p>

        <h2 class="sub-heading">3. Semi-supervised learning</h2>
        <p class="post-text">
            Semi-supervised learning offers a happy medium between supervised and unsupervised learning. During
            training, it uses a smaller labeled data set to guide classification and feature extraction from a larger,
            unlabeled data set. Semi-supervised learning can solve the problem of not having enough labeled data for a
            supervised learning algorithm. It also helps if it’s too costly to label enough data.
