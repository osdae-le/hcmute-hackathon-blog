        <h2 class="sub-heading">1. What is Natural Language Process (NLP)?</h2>
        <p class="post-text">Natural language processing (NLP) refers to the branch of computer science—and more
            specifically, the branch of artificial intelligence or AI—concerned with giving computers the ability to
            understand text and spoken words in much the same way human beings can.</p>
        <p class="post-text">NLP combines computational linguistics—rule-based modeling of human language—with
            statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models. Together, these technologies enable computers to
            process human language in the form of text or voice data and to ‘understand’ its full meaning, complete with
            the speaker or writer’s intent and sentiment.</p>
        <p class="post-text">NLP drives computer programs that translate text from one language to another, respond to
            spoken commands, and summarize large volumes of text rapidly—even in real time. There’s a good chance you’ve
            interacted with NLP in the form of voice-operated GPS systems, digital assistants, speech-to-text dictation
            software, customer service chatbots, and other consumer conveniences. But NLP also plays a growing role in
            enterprise solutions that help streamline business operations, increase employee productivity, and simplify
            mission-critical business processes.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-heading">2. NLP tasks</h2>
        <p class="post-text">Human language is filled with ambiguities that make it incredibly difficult to write
            software that accurately determines the intended meaning of text or voice data. Homonyms, homophones,
            sarcasm, idioms, metaphors, grammar and usage exceptions, variations in sentence structure—these just a few
            of the irregularities of human language that take humans years to learn, but that programmers must teach
            natural language-driven applications to recognize and understand accurately from the start, if those
            applications are going to be useful.</p>
        <p class="post-text">Several NLP tasks break down human text and voice data in ways that help the computer make
            sense of what it's ingesting. Some of these tasks include the following:</p>
        <p class="post-text">
            - Speech recognition, also called speech-to-text, is the task of reliably converting voice data into text
            data. Speech recognition is required for any application that follows voice commands or answers spoken
            questions. What makes speech recognition especially challenging is the way people talk—quickly, slurring
            words together, with varying emphasis and intonation, in different accents, and often using incorrect
            grammar.
        </p>
        <p class="post-text">
            - Part of speech tagging, also called grammatical tagging, is the process of determining the part of speech
            of
            a particular word or piece of text based on its use and context. Part of speech identifies ‘make’ as a verb
            in ‘I can make a paper plane,’ and as a noun in ‘What make of car do you own?’
            Word sense disambiguation is the selection of the meaning of a word with multiple meanings through a process
            of semantic analysis that determine the word that makes the most sense in the given context. For example,
            word sense disambiguation helps distinguish the meaning of the verb 'make' in ‘make the grade’ (achieve) vs.
            ‘make a bet’ (place).
        </p>
        <p class="post-text">
            - Natural language generation is sometimes described as the opposite of speech recognition or speech-to-text;
            it's the task of putting structured information into human language.
