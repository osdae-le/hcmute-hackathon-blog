            As machine learning technology has developed, it has certainly made our lives easier. However, implementing
            machine learning in businesses has also raised a number of ethical concerns about AI technologies. Some of
            these include:
        </p>
        <h2 class="sub-heading">1. Technological singularity</h2>
        <p class="post-text">
            While this topic garners a lot of public attention, many researchers are not concerned with the idea of AI
            surpassing human intelligence in the near future. Technological singularity is also referred to as strong AI
            or superintelligence. Philosopher Nick Bostrum defines superintelligence as “any intellect that vastly
            outperforms the best human brains in practically every field, including scientific creativity, general
            wisdom, and social skills.” Despite the fact that superintelligence is not imminent in society, the idea of
            it raises some interesting questions as we consider the use of autonomous systems, like self-driving cars.
            It’s unrealistic to think that a driverless car would never have an accident, but who is responsible and
            liable under those circumstances? Should we still develop autonomous vehicles, or do we limit this
            technology to semi-autonomous vehicles which help people drive safely? The jury is still out on this, but
            these are the types of ethical debates that are occurring as new, innovative AI technology develops.
        </p>
        <h2 class="sub-heading">2. AI impact on jobs</h2>
        <p class="post-text">
            While a lot of public perception of artificial intelligence centers around job losses, this concern should
            probably be reframed. With every disruptive, new technology, we see that the market demand for specific job
            roles shifts. For example, when we look at the automotive industry, many manufacturers, like GM, are
            shifting to focus on electric vehicle production to align with green initiatives. The energy industry isn’t
            going away, but the source of energy is shifting from a fuel economy to an electric one.
        </p>
        <p class="post-text">
            In a similar way, artificial intelligence will shift the demand for jobs to other areas. There will need to
            be individuals to help manage AI systems. There will still need to be people to address more complex
            problems within the industries that are most likely to be affected by job demand shifts, such as customer
            service. The biggest challenge with artificial intelligence and its effect on the job market will be helping
            people to transition to new roles that are in demand.
        </p>
        <h2 class="sub-heading">3. Privacy</h2>
        <p class="post-text">
            Privacy tends to be discussed in the context of data privacy, data protection, and data security. These
            concerns have allowed policymakers to make more strides in recent years. For example, in 2016, GDPR
            legislation was created to protect the personal data of people in the European Union and European Economic
            Area, giving individuals more control of their data. In the United States, individual states are developing
            policies, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which was introduced in 2018 and requires
            businesses to inform consumers about the collection of their data. Legislation such as this has forced
            companies to rethink how they store and use personally identifiable information (PII). As a result,
            investments in security have become an increasing priority for businesses as they seek to eliminate any
            vulnerabilities and opportunities for surveillance, hacking, and cyberattacks.
        </p>
        <h2 class="sub-heading">4. Accountability</h2>
        <p class="post-text">
            Since there isn’t significant legislation to regulate AI practices, there is no real enforcement mechanism
            to ensure that ethical AI is practiced. The current incentives for companies to be ethical are the negative
            repercussions of an unethical AI system on the bottom line. To fill the gap, ethical frameworks have emerged
            as part of a collaboration between ethicists and researchers to govern the construction and distribution of
            AI models within society. However, at the moment, these only serve to guide. Some research shows that the combination of distributed responsibility and a lack of foresight
            into potential consequences aren’t conducive to preventing harm to society.
